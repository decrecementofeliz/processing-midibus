# processing-midibus

Basic example of a processing sketch controlled by a MIDI device, using <a href="http://www.smallbutdigital.com/projects/themidibus/" target="_blank">The MidiBus library</a>. 
Some paremeters like background color, stroke color, speed of the animation or the size of the shape change on the fly as we move the knobs, buttons and sliders of our MIDI controller. 

Output:

To replicate, edit the the id of the MIDI device (shown in MidiBus.list()) and the numbers (and/or the channels) of the Controlller Change to match your device's.
